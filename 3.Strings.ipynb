    "A method is a function that is bound to the object.   \n",
    "There are many built-in functions which perform operations on strings. String objects also have many useful `methods` (i.e. functions which are attached to the objects, and accessed with the attribute reference operator `.`.\n",
    "Some of the commonly used methods are `format()` , `lower()`, `upper()`, `join()`, `split()`, `find()`, `replace()` etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are invoked as `object_name.method_name(arguments)`.   \n",
    "For example, in `s.find(\"e\")`  the string method `find()` is applied to the string `s` with one argument `\"e\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method `find()` searches a substring, passed as an argument, inside the string on which it's called. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, the method returns `-1`."
